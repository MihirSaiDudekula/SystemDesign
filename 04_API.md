## **1. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)**
- APIs define how different software components communicate.
- Used for data exchange between clients (frontend, mobile apps) and servers.
- API paradigms include **REST, GraphQL, and gRPC**.

---

## **2. API Paradigms**

### **A. REST (Representational State Transfer)**
- **REST is an architectural style** for designing web APIs.
- Based on **resources**, each identified by a URL.
- Uses **HTTP methods** (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) to perform actions on resources.

### **Key REST Concepts:**
1. **Resources** ‚Äì Everything is a resource (e.g., `/users`, `/orders`).
2. **Stateless** ‚Äì Each request is independent; the server doesn‚Äôt store client state.
3. **Client-Server Separation** ‚Äì The client only requests data, the server provides it.
4. **Cacheable** ‚Äì Responses can be cached for efficiency.

### **RESTful API Example:**
| HTTP Method | Endpoint | Action |
|------------|---------|---------|
| `GET` | `/users` | Fetch all users |
| `POST` | `/users` | Create a new user |
| `GET` | `/users/{id}` | Get a specific user |
| `PUT` | `/users/{id}` | Update user info |
| `DELETE` | `/users/{id}` | Delete a user |

### **Stateful vs Stateless APIs**
- **Stateless APIs** ‚Äì Each request is independent (REST APIs follow this).
- **Stateful APIs** ‚Äì The server maintains session state between requests (e.g., WebSockets, some RPCs).

### **REST API Issues:**
- **Overfetching** ‚Äì The client gets more data than needed.
- **Underfetching** ‚Äì The client needs multiple requests to get required data.

---

### **B. GraphQL**
- **GraphQL is a query language** for APIs developed by Facebook.
- Uses **only POST requests** (unlike REST, which uses multiple methods).

- In GraphQL, all requests are made using the POST method, regardless of whether you're fetching data, modifying data, or performing other actions. This is in contrast to REST APIs, which use different HTTP methods for different operations
- body can contain:

A query (a read operation, like fetching specific fields of data).
A mutation (a write operation, like creating or updating data).
A subscription (to listen for real-time updates).
Because GraphQL operates with a single endpoint, POST is chosen to accommodate the flexibility and complexity of the request body. The request is sent to a server with the required query or mutation in the request body, and the server responds with the requested data.


What is Overfetching and Underfetching?
Overfetching and underfetching are common problems in traditional REST APIs. These issues arise from the way data is requested and delivered in REST, where you typically request a fixed set of data from an endpoint.

Overfetching
Overfetching occurs when an API returns more data than what the client actually needs. This can happen when an endpoint returns a larger set of data than the client requires, leading to inefficiencies like:

Unnecessary network usage (since more data is transferred than necessary).
Increased response size (more data than needed).
Slower performance for the client and server.
For example, in a REST API, a request to fetch a list of users might also return unnecessary information about each user, like their posts, comments, or other details that are irrelevant to the current use case.

Example of Overfetching in REST:
Request: GET /users
Response:
json
Copy
[
  { "id": 1, "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com", "posts": [...] },
  { "id": 2, "name": "Bob", "email": "bob@example.com", "posts": [...] }
]
If the client only needs the user's name and email but the server still sends the posts, that's overfetching.

Underfetching
Underfetching occurs when an API doesn‚Äôt provide enough data in a single request, forcing the client to make multiple requests to get all the necessary information. This is a problem when an endpoint does not return all the relevant information in the response, requiring the client to fetch additional data by making multiple API calls.

For example, in a REST API, if you make a request to fetch user details but the server only returns basic information (like their name) and not their posts or other details, you will need to make a second request to get the posts or additional data.

Example of Underfetching in REST:
Request: GET /users/1
Response:
json
Copy
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "alice@example.com"
}
To get posts, you'd need to make a second request: GET /users/1/posts.

How GraphQL Solves These Problems
In GraphQL, these issues are solved in the following ways:

No Overfetching: The client specifies exactly what data it needs in the query. The server will return only the data requested, so there's no unnecessary data included in the response.
No Underfetching: The client can request all the data it needs in a single query. If you need the user's name, email, and posts, you can request them all in one request, and the server will return exactly what‚Äôs needed


- **Solves REST‚Äôs overfetching and underfetching problems**.

### **How GraphQL Works:**
1. **Client sends a single request** with a query specifying required fields.
2. **Server processes the query** and returns **only the requested data**.

#### **GraphQL Query Example (Client Request)**
```graphql
query {
  user(id: 1) {
    name
    email
    posts {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

#### **GraphQL Response (Server)**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "name": "Alice",
      "email": "alice@example.com",
      "posts": [
        { "title": "GraphQL Basics" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
‚úÖ **No overfetching or underfetching** ‚Äì The client specifies exactly what it needs.

### **GraphQL vs REST**
| Feature | REST | GraphQL |
|---------|------|---------|
| HTTP Methods | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE | Only POST |
| Overfetching | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| Underfetching | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| Response Format | Fixed JSON structure | Custom structure |
| Performance | Multiple requests | Single optimized request |

### **C. gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)**
- **gRPC** is an **RPC framework** by Google for high-performance communication.
- Uses **Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)** instead of JSON (more efficient).
- Works over **HTTP/2** (supports multiplexing multiple requests).

### **How gRPC Works:**
1. **Client calls a remote function**.
2. **Request is serialized using Protobuf** (efficient binary format).
3. **Server processes the request** and returns a serialized response.
4. **Client deserializes the response**.

### **Example gRPC Definition (Protobuf)**
```proto
syntax = "proto3";

service UserService {
  rpc GetUser (UserRequest) returns (UserResponse);
}

message UserRequest {
  int32 id = 1;
}

message UserResponse {
  string name = 1;
  string email = 2;
}
```

### **gRPC vs REST**
| Feature | REST | gRPC |
|---------|------|------|
| Protocol | HTTP 1.1 | HTTP/2 |
| Data Format | JSON (Text) | Protobuf (Binary) |
| Performance | Slower | Faster |
| Streaming | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Human-Readable | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No (Binary) |

### **Why gRPC Requires a Proxy**
- **Browsers do not natively support gRPC** (because it uses HTTP/2 and binary encoding).
- Requires a **gRPC-Web proxy** to communicate with frontend clients.

| API Paradigm | Stateless/Stateful | Issues | Best For |
|-------------|------------------|--------|----------|
| **REST** | Stateless | Overfetching, Underfetching | General APIs |
