# Object Storage: Architecture, Characteristics, and Use Cases

---

## 1. Introduction to Object Storage

**Object Storage** is a modern storage architecture that manages data as **objects**, unlike traditional block or file storage which use a file hierarchy or block-level addressing.

Each **object** includes:
- The **data** itself (e.g., an image, video, backup file).
- An associated **unique identifier** (object key or name).
- **Metadata**: Arbitrary key-value pairs describing the object (e.g., content type, timestamp).

It is **highly scalable**, **durable**, and designed for storing **large volumes of unstructured data**.

---

## 2. Examples of Object Storage Systems

- **AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)**
- **Google Cloud Storage**
- **Azure Blob Storage**
- **MinIO (open-source)**

These services expose **HTTP-based APIs** to store and retrieve data, making them ideal for web-scale applications.

## 3. Characteristics of Object Storage

### 3.1 **Flat Namespace**
- There is **no folder hierarchy** like in file systems.
- All objects exist in a **single addressable namespace** (like a huge key-value store).
- Logical directories can be **emulated** using naming conventions (e.g., `images/cats/001.jpg`), but internally it’s still flat.

### 3.2 **Scalability**
- Designed to scale to **billions of objects and petabytes of data**.
- Automatically manages data distribution across storage infrastructure.

### 3.3 **Durability and Availability**
- Provides high durability (e.g., **99.999999999%** or **"11 9s"** in S3) by **replicating data across multiple availability zones**.
- Ensures data is safe even during disk/node failures.

### 3.4 **Access via HTTP**
- Data is accessed using **standard HTTP(S)** protocols.
- Enables direct integration with web clients and content delivery networks (CDNs).

### 3.5 **Metadata Support**
- Every object can store **custom metadata** to describe the content.
- Useful for indexing, searching, and access control.

### 3.6 **No In-place Modification**
- Objects are **immutable**: to change a file, the entire object must be **overwritten**.
- Reduces complexity of consistency and concurrency handling.

## 4. What is a BLOB?

**BLOB** stands for **Binary Large Object**.

- It represents any large piece of unstructured binary data: video, image, log files, compressed backups, etc.
- In object storage, **each object is treated as a BLOB** and stored along with metadata.

## 5. Read/Write Permissions and Access Control

### Permission Mechanisms:
- Object storage services provide **fine-grained access control**.
- Can assign permissions **at object level** or **bucket (collection) level**.

Examples:
- **AWS S3 IAM policies**
- **Signed URLs** for temporary access
- **Public vs Private buckets**

### Operations:
- **GET**: Read object data
- **PUT**: Write or replace object data
- **DELETE**: Remove object
- **HEAD**: Read metadata without downloading the object

## 6. Why Object Storage is Preferred Over Traditional Databases for Large Files

### 6.1 Inefficiency of Databases for Large Files
- Traditional RDBMSs are optimized for **structured, transactional data**, not binary blobs.
- Storing large binary files in databases:
  - Consumes large I/O and memory
  - Increases DB size and backup/restore time
  - Reduces performance on transactional queries

### 6.2 Object Storage Is Optimized for Large File Delivery
- Access via **CDNs and HTTP** means files can be delivered directly to clients without database interaction.
- Designed for **streaming, caching, and parallel reads**, which are crucial for media and analytics workloads.

### 6.3 Better Cost and Performance Characteristics
- **Storage cost** is significantly lower than hot database storage.
- **Tiered storage** options (e.g., S3 Standard, S3 Glacier) allow cost optimization for infrequent access.
- Enables **decoupled architecture**: application servers don’t need to handle large files directly.

---

## 7. Common Use Cases of Object Storage

- **Media storage and delivery** (videos, images, audio)
- **Backup and archival** systems (due to durability and low cost)
- **Big data**: storing input/output of batch analytics jobs (e.g., using Spark or Hadoop)
- **Web applications**: user-uploaded files, documents
- **Machine Learning pipelines**: storing training datasets, model checkpoints
- **Log data** aggregation and long-term storage

---

## 8. Intuition: Why HTTP-Based Object Storage Scales Better

- **Stateless protocol**: HTTP is simple, scalable, and doesn’t maintain long-lived connections.
- Object storage acts as a **key-value store over HTTP**:
  - `PUT object` = store key-value
  - `GET object` = retrieve by key
- Enables **horizontal scaling**: multiple servers can handle different requests without coordination.
- Removes filesystem overhead (inode tables, directories, etc.) → **flat access** = better performance for web-scale systems.
